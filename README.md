websplit
========

WIP LiveSplit inspired (style) web browser based timer with splits.

[Live Demo](http://iotku.pw/websplit)

Currently being tested with Chrome and Firefox. Should also work in IE9+, [but doesn't currently](https://github.com/iotku/websplit/issues/8); it is confirmed working in IE11, and should work in most other browsers that don't break everything I try to use.

Abandon hope all ye who enter here: Welcome to my first attempt at doing stuff with javacript.

A while ago I had the idea of adding splits to http://w00ty.com/sda/timer/ but I never really stuck with it (and had zero javascript knowledge).

Now I'm mostly learning as I go and this timer is almost functional, and looks half decent on top of it.

There's still a fair bit of stuff I need to work out, but this is pretty much the furthest I've gotten with anything programming related.

Good luck, have fun.
